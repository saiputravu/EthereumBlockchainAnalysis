# Ethereum Blockchain Analysis

## Motivation
I became fascinated about the blockchain as it is open for everyone to see and use. It also abstracts user information in the form of a wallet address. 
Since anyone can create a wallet, this level of anonymity has unfortunately paved path for financial fraud on this platform. 

I believe it is now important to develop tools to improve our analysis capability on this platform and this repository is my way of experimenting with what is possible.
